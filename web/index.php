              enterprise as well as home use. Not only is VirtualBox an extremely feature rich, high performance product for enterprise
              customers, it is also the only professional solution that is freely available as Open Source Software under the terms of
              the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2. See "About VirtualBox" for an introduction.<br/>
              Presently, VirtualBox runs on Windows, Linux, Macintosh, and Solaris hosts and supports a large number of guest operating
              systems including but not limited to Windows (NT 4.0, 2000, XP, Server 2003, Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10),
              DOS/Windows 3.x, Linux (2.4, 2.6, 3.x and 4.x), Solaris and OpenSolaris, OS/2, and OpenBSD.<br/>
              VirtualBox is being actively developed with frequent releases and has an ever growing list of features, supported guest
              operating systems and platforms it runs on. VirtualBox is a community effort backed by a dedicated company: everyone is
              encouraged to contribute while Oracle ensures the product always meets professional quality criteria.

              Vagrant is a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments in a single workflow. With an easy-to-use workflow
              and focus on automation, Vagrant lowers development environment setup time, increases production parity, and makes
              the "works on my machine" excuse a relic of the past.

              <td style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Docker</strong>
              Developing apps today requires so much more than writing code. Multiple languages, frameworks, architectures, and
              discontinuous interfaces between tools for each lifecycle stage creates enormous complexity. Docker simplifies and
              accelerates your workflow, while giving developers the freedom to innovate with their choice of tools, application stacks,
              and deployment environments for each project.
